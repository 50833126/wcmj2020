"Leo is a revolutionary step in the right direction for programming."―Brian Takita
"Leo is the best IDE that I have had the pleasure to use. It has totally changed not only the way that I program, but also the way that I store and organize all of the information that I need for the job that I do."―Ian Mulvany
"When first I opened Leo, it was out of curiosity. But having used it, I'll never go back. They'll have to pry Leo out of my cold, dead fingers!"―Travers A. Hough
Leo is a PIM, IDE and outliner that accelerates the work flow of programmers, authors and web designers. Outline nodes may appear in more than one place, allowing multiple organizations of data within a single outline.
